# jQuery

simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed:

- SELECT ELEMENTS 
- PERFORM TASKS
- HANDLE EVENTS

**SIMPLE SELECTORS:**

jQuery uses a language that is already familiar to front-end web developers: CSS selectors

- faster at selecting elements
- more accurate about which elements to select
- require a lot less code than older DOM methods
- used by most front-end developers
- adds some extra CSS-style selectors which offer additional functionality.

**COMMON TASKS IN LESS CODE**

jQuery has methods that offer web developers simpler ways to perform:

- Add and remove elements from the DOM tree
- Handle events
- loop through elements
- Handle Ajax requests

**CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY**

jQuery automatically handles the inconsistent ways in which browsers select elements and handle events, so you do not need to write cross-browser fallback code

**LOOPING**

In plain JavaScript, if you wanted to do the same thing to several elements, you would need to write code to loop through all of the elements you selected

*when a selector returns multiple elements, you can update all of them using the one method. There is no need to use a loop*

**CHAINING**

The process of placing several methods in the same selector is referred to as chaining

**UPDATING ELEMENTS**

Here are four methods that update the content of all elements in a jQuery selection :

- html() :

This method gives every element in the matched set the same new content. The new content may include HTML.

- text():

This method gives every element in the matched set the same new text content. Any markup would be shown as text.

- replaceWith():

This method replaces every element in a matched set with new content. It also returns the replaced elements.

- remove():

This method removes all of the elements in the matched set.

- before():

This method inserts content before the selected element(s) .

- prepend():

This method inserts content inside the selected element(s), after the opening tag

- after():

This method inserts content after the selected element(s).

- append():

This method inserts content inside the selected element(s), before the closing tag

**GETTING AND SETTING ATTRIBUTE VALUES**

- .attr()

This method can get or set a specified attribute and its value. To get the value of an attribute, you specify the name of the attribute in the parentheses.

- .removeAttr() 

This method removes a specified attribute (and its value)

- .addClass()

This method adds a new value to the existing value of the cl ass attribute. It does not overwrite existing values.

- .removeClass()

This method removes a value from the cl ass attribute, leaving any other class names within that attribute intact. These
