# Node.js:

- is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
- event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
- is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

**npm**

- is the JavaScript Package Manager.
- To check which version you have installed on your system, type `npm -v`.
- is the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week. Let’s take a quick look at how we would use npm to install a package.

**Installing a Package Globally**

- `npm install -g jshint`

**Installing a Package locally**

- `npm init -y`

**Working with the package.json File**

- The node_modules folder shouldn’t be checked in to version control, his is where npm has saved lodash and any libraries that lodash depends on.

**What Is Node.js Used For?**

 - They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.
 - Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server

 **Downsides for node**

 - The fact that Node runs in a single thread does impose some limitations.
-  the callback-based style of coding that JavaScript imposes (so much so that there’s even a site dedicated to the horrors of writing asynchronous JavaScript).

**Apps Of Node.js**

- chat sites
-  CoeShare
- APIs
- sites involving data streaming

**Advantages of Node.js**

- speed and scalability
- everything in the same language
- speaks JSON
- javaScript is ubiquitous
