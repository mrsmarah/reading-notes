# Videos & Audios:

**HTMLMediaElement API**

 - provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically:
 
1- `HTMLMediaElement.play()`
2- `HTMLMediaElement.pause()`

This interface is available to both `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical.

**The `<video>` element**

`<video src="rabbit320.webm" controls></video>`

**The `<audio>` element**

`<audio controls>`
    ` <source src="viper.mp3" type="audio/mp3">`
    ` <source src="viper.ogg" type="audio/ogg">`
`</audio>`
