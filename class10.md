# Debugging and handling errors 

**Execution contexts:**

- If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code. 

**Console:**

- The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error. 

**Javascripts errors:**

- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error. 

**Helpful Statements to handle the errors:**

If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using:

 - try statements
 - catch statements
 - finally statements
 
*Use them to give your users helpful feedback.*

*Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.*
