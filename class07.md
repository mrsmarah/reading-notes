# Domain Modeling:

- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the objectâ€™s properties and methods from inside.



# HTML 

## Chapter 6: Tables 
(pp.126-145)


The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page.

A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created  with the `<tr>` element.

Inside each row there are a number of cells  X represented by the `<td>` element or `<th>` if it is a header.

You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. 

For long tables you can split the table into a  `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.




# JS

## Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects 
(pp.106-144)


`var objectName = new constructor function ;`
 ` var name = new person(25 , boy);`
 ` name.age(25);`
 ` name.gender(boy);`

  
**So there is two ways to create an object :**

- LITERAL NOTATION
- OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION

**Built in objects**

1- window object
2- document object
3- string object
4- number object
5- math object
6- date object
