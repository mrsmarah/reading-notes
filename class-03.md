# Javascript Templating

- Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. 
- The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

# Mustache

- Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code â€” anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
