# Functional programming:

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

**Immutability**

- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed..
- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
- So here we have the sum function that receives a vector of numerical values. The function calls itself until we get the list empty (our recursion base case). For each "iteration" we will add the value to the total accumulator.

# Refactoring JavaScript :

- Performance  
- Readability

**Senarios:**

- URL-shortening website
- social media website
- Return early from functions
- Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
- Check for Web APIs before implementing
